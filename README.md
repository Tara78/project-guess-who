Guess who ; 
In this game you are playing with the computer. Computer choosing a random character and u can  guess which the character is by narrowing down by asking diffrent questions. U can choose different options such as, hair, eyes color or accessories. 

I put the counter , player can try 5 times, if player would not win has to start a new game. 


## The problem

Filtering was a bit difficult to me. and playing again and restaring was not sp easy neither. 

to playagain i used location.reload() method in clickEvent on the playAgain button. I check Stackoverflow,I tried many diffrennet solutions, but just location.reload work well in my code. 

I didnot know the rule of this game. It took me a while to undestand what is require for this game. Perhaps next time I will read many times the instruction. 

If I had more time , I would add sound effects for winer or loser, and timer.
